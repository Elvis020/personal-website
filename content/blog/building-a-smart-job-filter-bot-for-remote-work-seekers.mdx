## How It Started: A Simple Frustration

I'm part of a Telegram group where a friend regularly posts job opportunities in a sub-channel called "Jobs." Every day, new links. New possibilities. New hope.

But here's what kept happening:

1. Click link
2. Read through the entire job description
3. Get excited about the role
4. Scroll down to location requirements
5. See "US-based only" or "Remote (EU timezone required)"
6. Close tab. Feel frustrated.

This wasn't a one-time thing. It was happening **multiple times a day**. Each click represented wasted time - time I could've spent actually applying to jobs I *could* get, or learning a new skill, or literally anything else.

The worst part? The word "remote" in the job title. It sounds so promising! Until you realize "remote" often means "remote within our specific country/timezone/continent."

One evening, after clicking through yet another "remote" job that turned out to be California-only, I thought: **"There has to be a better way."**

That's when I decided to build **Ghana Jobs Bot** - a Telegram bot that checks if a job is actually accessible from Ghana *before* I waste my time reading it.

## Why This Matters

This problem isn't unique to Ghana. If you're looking for remote work from Africa, South America, Asia, Eastern Europe, or anywhere outside the US/EU/UK, you know this pain. Job boards are filled with "remote" positions that quietly exclude you.

**Ghana Jobs Bot** filters jobs before you waste time reading them.

## What It Does

The bot uses a simple command:
```
/check https://careers.company.com/job/12345
```

And replies with one of four verdicts:
- ✅ **Helpful** - Worldwide remote or Ghana-based
- 🌍 **Visa Sponsorship** - Offers relocation support
- ❌ **Not Helpful** - Location-restricted, excludes Ghana
- ❓ **Unclear** - Cannot determine requirements

## The Technical Journey

### Stack & Architecture

**Core Technologies:**
- Python 3.12 + python-telegram-bot
- Claude AI for intelligent analysis
- SQLite for caching
- Fly.io for hosting

I chose Claude AI because it excels at nuanced text analysis - perfect for parsing job requirements where "remote" could mean anything from "worldwide" to "San Francisco office only."

### Challenge #1: URL Detection That Actually Works

**Initial Approach:**
```python
JOB_DOMAINS = [
    'linkedin.com/jobs',
    'indeed.com',
    '/jobs/',  # Generic pattern
]
```

**The Problem:**
This missed tons of real job sites! `careers.jackhenry.com/job/...` wouldn't match because I only checked for `/jobs/` (plural), not `/job/` (singular).

**The Solution:**
Add comprehensive patterns:
```python
JOB_DOMAINS = [
    '/jobs/',      # Plural
    '/job/',       # Singular
    '/careers/',   # Path-based
    'careers.',    # Subdomain
    'jobs.',       # jobs.company.com
    'apply.',      # Application portals
]
```

This catches 95% of job sites while keeping false positives low.

### Challenge #2: Automatic vs. Manual Operation

**What I Learned the Hard Way:**

I initially built the bot to automatically detect job links in group messages. Seemed smart, right? Wrong.

**Problems:**
1. **Privacy Mode** - Telegram bots can't see regular messages by default
2. **Noise** - Bot reacting to every link cluttered the chat
3. **Unclear intent** - Users didn't know when the bot would activate
4. **False positives** - Reacting to non-job URLs was annoying

**The Pivot:**
Switched to **manual commands only**:
```python
# Before (automatic)
application.add_handler(
    MessageHandler(filters.TEXT, handle_message)
)

# After (manual)
application.add_handler(
    CommandHandler("check", check_command)
)
```

This made the bot:
- More reliable (no privacy mode issues)
- Less noisy (users control when it activates)
- Clearer to use (explicit `/check` command)
- Better UX overall

### Challenge #3: Visa Sponsorship Detection

**The Insight:**

A job that says "US only" but offers visa sponsorship is actually *more valuable* than one with vague requirements. I needed to detect and prioritize these.

**Implementation:**
```python
VISA_SPONSORSHIP_KEYWORDS = [
    r"visa\s+sponsor(?:ship)?",
    r"h-?1b\s+sponsor(?:ship)?",
    r"relocation\s+(?:and\s+)?visa",
    r"immigration\s+support",
    r"willing\s+to\s+sponsor",
]
```

**Detection Priority:**
1. Check for visa sponsorship **first**
2. Then check location restrictions
3. Then check for worldwide remote
4. Finally, use AI if still unclear

This ensures jobs like "US-based with H-1B sponsorship" get flagged as opportunities, not rejections.

### Challenge #4: Claude AI Integration

**The Smart Fallback:**

When keyword matching fails, Claude AI reads the full job posting:

```python
prompt = f"""Analyze this job posting for someone in Ghana, Africa.

Determine if they can apply. Answer with ONE of:
- HELPFUL: Available to Ghana residents
- VISA_SPONSORSHIP: Offers visa/relocation support
- NOT_HELPFUL: Restricted, excludes Ghana
- UNCLEAR: Cannot determine

Consider:
- "Remote" alone often means US-remote
- Timezone requirements (Ghana = GMT+0)
- Visa/work authorization mentions

Job Details:
{job_content}

Answer in format:
VERDICT: [HELPFUL/VISA_SPONSORSHIP/NOT_HELPFUL/UNCLEAR]
REASON: [One sentence explanation]
"""
```

This hybrid approach (rules + AI) gives:
- Fast responses (cached keyword matches)
- High accuracy (AI handles edge cases)
- Cost-effective (AI only when needed)


## Key Features

- **Smart Caching**: Results are cached for 24 hours, giving instant responses for repeat URLs
- **Command Menu**: Built-in Telegram commands (`/check`, `/help`, `/clearcache`) visible when users type `/`
- **Graceful Error Handling**: If scraping fails, the bot falls back to analyzing available text instead of crashing

## Deployment

The bot runs 24/7 on Fly.io's free tier with persistent SQLite storage. Total cost: $0/month.

## Lessons Learned

**Start Simple**: Begin with keyword matching, add complexity only when needed. Each feature solved a real problem.

**Manual > Automatic**: Users want control, not magic that sometimes works. Explicit commands beat auto-detection.

**Detection Order Matters**: Checking visa sponsorship *before* location restrictions changed everything. Logic order shapes user experience.

**Cache Aggressively**: 24-hour caching reduced API calls by 80% without sacrificing accuracy.

**Always Have Fallbacks**: When scraping fails, analyze available text. When AI fails, return "unclear" not an error.

## The Results

The bot delivers instant responses for cached URLs with high accuracy thanks to the keyword + AI combination. Visa sponsorship detection turned out to be a game-changer, revealing opportunities we'd previously dismissed.

Some job sites still have anti-scraping protection, and generic "remote" mentions can be unclear, but the bot handles the vast majority of cases correctly.

## Real-World Impact

What used to take 5-10 minutes per job (reading, getting excited, discovering restrictions) now takes **10 seconds**. That's 30-50x faster.

Group members now focus on jobs they can actually apply to instead of getting demoralized by rejections. My friend filters jobs before sharing, so the channel has higher-quality opportunities. The visa sponsorship detection revealed a whole category of jobs we'd been dismissing.

The bot didn't just save time. It changed how we approach job hunting.

## Future Improvements

Potential additions include LinkedIn/Indeed API integration, user preference settings, saved searches with notifications, and multi-language support.

## Conclusion

What started as personal frustration turned into a tool that helps my entire Telegram group. The best solutions come from solving your own problems - I built for *me*, frustrated after clicking yet another California-only "remote" job.

If you're building something similar, start with your actual pain point. Don't build what you think people need - build what you know you need, because you've felt that pain multiple times a day.

That Telegram "Jobs" channel that used to frustrate me? Now it's actually useful. And that's worth every line of code.
